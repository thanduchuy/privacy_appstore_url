      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p>
        This privacy policy applies to the
        <strong>SleepGood: Better Sleep</strong> app (hereby referred to as
        "Application") for mobile devices that was created by Than Duc Huy
        (hereby referred to as "Service Provider") as a Free service. This
        service is intended for use "AS IS".
      </p>

        </li>
        <li>The time spent on the Application</li>

      </ul>

      <p>
        The Application does not gather precise information about the location

      </p>

      <p>
        The Service Provider may use the information you provided to contact you
        from time to time to provide you with important information, required
        notices and marketing promotions.
      </p>

      <p>
        For a better experience, while using the Application, the Service
        Provider may require you to provide us with certain personally
        identifiable information. The information that the Service Provider
        request will be retained by them and used as described in this privacy
        policy.
      </p>

      <strong>Third Party Access</strong>
      <p>
        Only aggregated, anonymized data is periodically transmitted to external
        services to aid the Service Provider in improving the Application and
        their service. The Service Provider may share your information with
        third parties in the ways that are described in this privacy statement.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Service Provider may disclose User Provided and Automatically
        Collected Information:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar
          legal process;
        </li>
        <li>
          when they believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to
          protect their rights, protect your safety or the safety of others,
          investigate fraud, or respond to a government request;
        </li>
        <li>
          with their trusted services providers who work on their behalf, do not
          have an independent use of the information we disclose to them, and
          have agreed to adhere to the rules set forth in this privacy
          statement.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <strong>Opt-Out Rights</strong>
      <p>
        You can stop all collection of information by the Application easily by
        uninstalling it. You may use the standard uninstall processes as may be
        available as part of your mobile device or via the mobile application
        marketplace or network.
      </p>

      <strong>Data Retention Policy</strong>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>
        The Service Provider does not knowingly collect personally identifiable
        information from children. The Service Provider encourages all children
        to never submit any personally identifiable information through the
        Application and/or Services. The Service Provider encourage parents and
        legal guardians to monitor their children's Internet usage and to help
        enforce this Policy by instructing their children never to provide
        personally identifiable information through the Application and/or
        Services without their permission. If you have reason to believe that a
        child has provided personally identifiable information to the Service
        Provider through the Application and/or Services, please contact the
        Service Provider at
        <a href="mailto:thanduchuy003@gmail.com">thanduchuy003@gmail.com</a> so
        that they will be able to take the necessary actions. You must also be
        at least 16 years of age to consent to the processing of your personally
        identifiable information in your country (in some countries we may allow
        your parent or guardian to do so on your behalf).

        The Service Provider is concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality
        of your information. The Service Provider provides physical, electronic,
